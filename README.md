## Football Dispossession Regression Analysis


## Introduction
The FDRA Program is a python project that can be used to predict how often a football player gets dispossesed of the ball. The purpose of this is to analyse trends in football, the application of this program could be used in fields such as sports betting to football training. 

The project uses regression analysis to analyse a collection of independent variables (see below) to produce a formula that can be used to predict the dependent variable (Dispossessions per 90 minutes)


## Data
The default data used for the analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/greggblenkinsop/football-dispossession-regression-analysis/blob/master/data.csv) and is sourced directly from:
